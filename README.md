<p style="text-align:justify;color:#2E4057;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:1.1em">
<b>Introduction</b> An ACO - Accountable Care Organization has developed an outreach program where a team of health coaches will work with members to reduce their risk of stroke. However, they do not have enough resources to engage every member of their population. Therefore, they would like us to develop a model that can be used to match the health coaches with those individuals who have the highest risk of stroke.  <br>
<br>    
<b>Business Process:</b> Currently, a manual approach is used to engage health coaches with members of ACO. <br>
<br>
<b>Limitations:</b> Do not have enough resources to engage every member of their population. <br>
<br>
<b>Business Requirement:</b> Predicting highest stroke risk based on various factors like lifestyle and  clinical data
